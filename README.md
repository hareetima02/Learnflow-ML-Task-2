# Traffic Sign Recognition

Traffic Sign Recognition is a project aimed at creating a machine learning or deep learning model capable of detecting and classifying traffic signs from images. This technology can be a key component of autonomous driving systems and intelligent traffic management solutions.

This project was part of an internship under Learnflow Services. It corresponds to **Learnflow-ML-Task-2**, which required the development of a model to recognize and classify traffic signs in images for autonomous driving applications.

## Overview
Traffic signs play a vital role in regulating road traffic and ensuring safety. Automating their recognition can:
- Enhance autonomous vehicle navigation.
- Aid drivers by providing real-time alerts.
- Contribute to smarter traffic monitoring systems.

This project leverages advanced techniques in computer vision and deep learning to build an accurate traffic sign recognition model.

---

## Features
- Supports detection and classification of multiple traffic sign categories.
- Uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for high-accuracy image recognition.
- Provides detailed metrics on model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).

---

## Dataset
This project utilizes a publicly available traffic sign dataset, such as the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/). The dataset contains labeled images of various traffic signs.

### Dataset Highlights:
- Diverse set of traffic sign images.
- Multiple categories including speed limits, warnings, prohibitions, etc.
- Pre-processed for efficient training and evaluation.

---

## Model Architecture
The project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. Key components include:
- **Convolutional Layers:** For feature extraction.
- **Pooling Layers:** To reduce spatial dimensions.
- **Dense Layers:** For classification.

Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs can be configured to optimize model performance.
